# Finance

**This is not "financial advice;" this is technology advice.**

Money isn't real. None of it is. Even Monopoly money has _some_ value, which can be defined as, "whatever everyone agrees it's worth," like anything else. General consensus is what defines the price of goods and even the price of the price. Modern financial systems are as centralized as can be, by design, so control over "your" funds can be allotted to you as a controlling party sees fit. As [Ledger puts it](https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters),

> Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins

## Cryptocurrency

The federal (not-federated) government can seize/hold your normie financial assets at any time. Cryptocurrency is often seen as a get-rich-quick scheme for many, but the exciting part of this "new" means of wealth acquisition is moreso in the independence and safe automation of transactions between disparate parties. While it does enable some anonymous dealings for less-than-legal items, it also allows the rest of the world to operate their finances without a central authority.
