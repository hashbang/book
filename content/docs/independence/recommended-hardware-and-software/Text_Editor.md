# Text Editor

> Do I *really* need you to tell me which **text editor** I should be using? You've gone too far.

Consider the fact that you're a software engineer that's not fortunate enough to work in the open source community. The code/content that you type can be sensitive. You should feel secure in knowing that your keystrokes are safe. Fortunately, there are capable text editors that are completely free, with source code you can audit and build, yourself.
