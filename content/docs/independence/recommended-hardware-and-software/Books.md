# Books

Amazon currently dominates the market, currently, with Kindle, Audible, and even physical, printed books. Regardless of how you've obtained your media, it's your right to be able to consume it without being tracked. It doesn't take a lot of effort to circumvent the DRM from the more popular apps that control your purchased content.

### Hardware

Android phone/tablet.

### Software

[Book Reader](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.bookreader/) is a no-frills reader for text files that can do basic things like save your position and toggle light vs dark mode. It also has TTS (text-to-speech) output from the default engine your device is using. It's pretty funny to listen to books using [eSpeak](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.reecedunn.espeak/)'s collection of voices.

Removing the DRM from Kindle books is possible on a machine with Kindle for PC or Mac using [DeDRM_tools](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM).

## Audio

### Hardware

- Android phone/tablet

### Software

- [Voice](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.ph1b.audiobook/) plays most audio file types, maintains your last position when listening, and has one notable feature that is lacking in proprietary apps (such as Audible) — **Volume Boost**.

If you've paid for books on Audible, you can easily convert your entire library with [AAXtoMP3](https://github.com/KrumpetPirate/AAXtoMP3).
