# Locomotive Navigation

What does "locomotive navigation" even mean? It's just an explicit way of saying "getting around."

An ideal navigation tool would never require any external signal besides clear view of the sky for GPS when it's time to get somewhere. Maps and other metadata can and should be downloaded to be used offline.
