## Linux Hardening

The following is an opinionated minimal-compromises reference to configuring a
maximally secure Linux system for high stakes use cases where privacy and
security are favored over compatibility, cost, or effeciency.

This intends to be largely a showcase of the work of others and act as a
starting point for researching this space.

Note: Linux is -not- the right choice for every project.

If you can get away with a lean security-focused kernel like Sle4, do that and
ignore this. Linux introduces a -lot- of attack surface that most projects
don't actually need.

## Threat Profile

* Target protects:
  * Automated air/ground transportation
  * Nuclear weapons
  * Electric grid
  * Medical implants
  * Dive computers
  * Secrets that could end any entity
  * Access to unlimited financial gain
  * Human lives
* Attacker has
  * No ethics
  * unlimited funding
  * decades of patience
  * Knowledge deeper than yours of every component
  * 0-days of any currently known class
* Attacker can
  * compromise any single point in the supply chain
  * compromise any single system
  * compromise any single individual
* Attacker wants
  * Theft (cryptocurrency, bank accounts, stock tips, blackmail, databases)
  * Sabotage (to a company or country for any reason)
  * Chaos (May not be rational)

## Design

* Favor security and privacy over efficiency
* Every system:
  * is treated as a single purpose immutable appliance
  * replaced not updated
* Every component must be:
  * auditable by anyone
  * reproducible deterministically by anyone
  * audited by multiple reputable third parties.
  * fail on any unathorized physical tampering attempt
  * handle cryptographic operations in constant time
  * maintain secret keys physically separate from networks
  * have the bare minimum resources to complete its intended function

## Implementation

### Code Review (WIP)

#### Overview
#### Recommendations

* Decentralized
* Multisig
* Coding practices

### Dependency Management (WIP)
#### Overview
#### Recommendations

* review practices
* Signed reproducible builds must be possible
* Code must be signed with a well-known key of author and ideally reviewer(s)
* Consider reviews by any distribution channel maintainers
* Always assume force pushes and tag clobbers: pin hashes
* Assume upstreams will vanish without warning: mirror everything yourself

#### Background

### Release Management (WIP)
#### Overview
#### Recommendations

* Reproducible builds
* Signing

#### Background

### Static Application Security Testing (WIP)

#### Overview

Static analysis analyzes source code or compiled binaries for security flaws.
A critical part of a security focused software development is using tools
to help catch common human errors before code hits production.

Memory bugs are most common and where possible one should favor memory safe
languages designed for security: Rust, Go, OCaml, Zig

#### Recommendations

##### Language Agnostic

* Google CodeSearchDiggity
* Graudit
* LGTM
* SonarQube
* VisualCodeGrepper

##### Bash
* shellcheck

##### Node.js
* synode

##### C/C++
* BOON
* CQual
* xg++
* Eau Claire tool
* MOPS
* Split
* Flawfinder
* PreFast

##### C#
* Puma Scan
* .Net Security Guard

##### Python
* Bandit

##### Ruby
* Brakeman

### Sandboxing (WIP)

#### Overview
#### Recommendations

##### SELinux
##### Apparmor
##### Seccomp
##### cgroups
##### namespacing

### Filesystem (WIP)

Everything on unix is a file, and as such filesystem mount options and
permissions are one of the most effective ways to restrict what can or can't
be done in a given directory.

Everything should be either a read-only filesystem like quashfs or a tmpfs.
Never allow writes to root filesystem.

This is all managed via /etc/fstab

#### Overview

#### Recommendations

##### Mount options

###### Restrict /proc so users can only see their own processes
* Usage: ```proc /proc proc defaults,hidepid=2 0 0```

###### Disable suid binaries in /dev
* Usage: ```udev /dev devtmpfs defaults,nosuid,noexec,noatime 0 0```

###### Force mode 0666 in /dev/pts
* Usage: ```devpts /dev/pts devpts defaults,newinstance,ptmxmode=0666 0 0```

###### Use tmpfs for /dev/shm and restrict suid, exec, and dev
* Usage: ```tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0```

###### Use tmpfs for /tmp and disable devices, suid binaries, and exec
* Usage: ```tmpfs /tmp tmpfs nodev,nosuid,noexec,size=2G 0 0```

###### Bind /var/tmp to /tmp and restrict suid, exec, and dev
* Usage: ```/tmp /var/tmp none rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,bind 0 0```

  * Convert indirect calls and jumps to call and return thunks
  * Used in Spectre v2 attack mitigations to prevent CPU branch speculation
* Notes:
  * thunk: create one thunk section per input file
  * thunk-inline: create one per indirect branch or function return

  * https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/856627/

###### Stack Canaries
* Usage: ```-fstack-protector-strong```
* Intention:
  * Plant random "canary" integers just before stack return pointers
  * Buffer overflows hijacking return pointer will normally modify canary
  * Ensure canary is still present before a routine uses a pointer on stack
* Resources:
  * https://outflux.net/blog/archives/2014/01/27/fstack-protector-strong/
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection#Canaries

###### Position Independent Executables (PIE)
* Usage:
  * Statically compiled: ```-static-pie```
  * Allow linking PICs: ```-fPIE -pie```
* Intention:
  * Only allow PIC libraries to be linked into executables
  * When used in with ASLR, all program memory is allocated randomly together
  * Increase difficulty of using exploits that assume a specific memory layout
* Resources:
  * http://www.openbsd.org/papers/nycbsdcon08-pie/

###### Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
* Usage: ```-Wl,-z,noexecstack -Wl,-z,noexecheap```
* Intention:
  * Buffer overflows tend to put code in programs stack and jump to it

  * https://linux.die.net/man/8/execstack

###### Source Fortification
* Usage: ```-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -O2``` or ```-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -O2``` (the latter adds runtime overhead)
* Intention:
  * Many programs rely on functions that are not aware of buffer-length
  * Buffer overflow exploits often take advantage of these functions
  * Examples include strncpy, strcpy, memcpy, memset
  * Fail compilation if these are used in obviously unsafe way.

  * Lazy binding loads libraries into memory when first accessed
  * A reference is left in the Global Offset Table in a known location
  * Having a well known memory addreseses makes an attackers job easier
  * Make shared libraries read-only after dynamic relocations are applied
  * Limit ability of attacker to overwrite GOT entries to shared functions

##### C/POSIX Standard Library Implementation

###### musl
* Notes:
  * Small binaries (~13k hello world vs ~600k with glibc)
  * Small .a/.so footprint (~1MB vs ~10MB for glibc)
  * Small codebase designed to be easy to audit
  * Supported by security focused Linux distros (linuxkit, gentoo, alpine)
  * Low-memory or resource exhaustion conditions are never fatal
  * Wider support for microcontrollers and embedded targets than glibc
  * Rapid termination on security violation to limit attacks on error codepaths
  * Can build itself with ASLR to catching internal stack-smashing
  * Double-Free protection (as possible)
  * Moderate heap-overflow detection
  * Use PIE together with static-linking
  * Limited machine-specific code minimizing chances of minority arch breakage
  * Limit buggy translations via forced literal strings without format strings

  * Attempts to remove all undefined behavior. Less code == less bugs
  * Safe, fully-standards-conforming UTF-8 (source of many security bugs)
  * Consistent results even under transient errors without silent fallbacks
  * Lazy/Late allocations that would abort on failure are unsupported

### Kernel

#### Overview

While Linux is certianly not designed for out-of-the-box high security it is
the most portable for the widest range of use cases and has the largest number
of deployments so advice in this section will assume it.

If your application does not require a Linux kernel it is suggested the reader
carefully consider security-focused alternatives like OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
FreeRTOS, or seL4.

Some of these features don't ship with any published binary kernels for any
major distribution so it is assumed the reader will compile their own kernel
with a hardened toolchain following the advice in the Toolchain section of this
document.
